# bikesharing-predictions
Predicting number of bike-sharing users on a given day

The repository uses numpy and pandas to accurately predict daily bike rental ridership in a month. The code is commented to guide you through all the steps to building a deep neural network at a very basic level, without any libraries built specifically for this purpose.
